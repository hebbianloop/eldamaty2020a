\section*{Introduction}
The prevalence of social deviance across the life course has been well-documented to dramatically increase in adolescence before peaking in emerging adulthood \citep{loeber2011young,farrington1986age,maguire2004sourcebook,finkelhor2009children}. The etiological underpinnings of youth violence have been extensively studied, yielding sociological and behavioral models that seek to explain what makes the transitional period between adolescence and young adulthood an effective incubatory phase for antisocial behavior \citep{LunaWright2016,dahl2004adolescent}. Yet the causal link between social strain, cognition, and subsequent antisocial decision-making remains a challenging scientific problem for cognitive neuroscientists \citep{meisel2019mind,poldrack2018predicting}.

\paragraph{Sociological Models of Social Deviance} To understand this challenge, let's begin with legacy theories of antisocial behavior. Sociological research has identified the role of family and social relationships \citep{tolan1997assessment,henry2001longitudinal}, accessibility of public services \citep{molnar2008effects}, and the presence of chronic strain from environmental adversity, such as neighborhood crime or victimization \citep{esbensen1991juvenile} as the most significant factors for predicting the emergence of delinquency in adolescence and the persistence of offending into adulthood. However, these are all exogenous factors and do not explain how a socially deviant decision is constructed from perception to action. The General Strain Model (GSM) broaches this gap as a construct for the causal link between social strain, internal emotional states, and subsequent delinquent behavior \citep{agnew2001building,agnew2007pressure}. Environmental adversity, such as neighborhood crime and impaired socioeconomic mobility, is considered to interact with experiences of violence to directly cause social deviance and delinquency. Social strains are described as increasing the likelihood of negative emotions, enforcing the perceptions of social exclusion, and hypothesized to provide pressure for taking corrective action to ameliorate the causes of experienced stress. The loss of positive reinforcement, such as through dysfunctional interpersonal relationships, or the perception of social barriers to goal achievement, are also included as sources of internal emotional strain that may lead to social deviance. Corrective action may take the form of elevated drug use to mitigate negative feelings or the absence of positive ones \citep{slocum2010general}, or it may take the form of retaliation directed at the perceived sources of stress \citep{warner2003strain}. Unfortunately, a single retaliation or corrective action in adolescence can lead to a turning point, in which decisions become more and more likely to self-reinforce perceptions of exclusion and existing stress, potentially culminating in a lifetime of persistent offending \citep{laub1993turning}. 

\paragraph{Youth Antisociality \& Cognitive Development} The original proponent behind GSM, Agnew, notes in his reflections that the model on its own does not explain why adolescents are more likely to engage in social deviance compared to adults \citep{froggio2007strain,agnew2012reflection}. Adults also experience social strain but do not engage in antisocial behavior at the same levels as those transitioning from adolescence into emerging adulthood. The hint for arriving at a reconciliation of this distinction is the appeal to cognitive mechanisms of emotional responses to perceived stress that may explain deviant social decision making in the GSM. Elaborations of the GSM have called attention to the importance of ongoing socio-emotional cognitive development during adolescence for understanding why environmental and social influences have an especially effective impact on youth risk for antisocial behavior \citep{hasking2007reinforcement}. Cognitive neuroscience experiments have demonstrated that the adolescent brain undergoes a timed maturation of discrete cognitive systems underlying social behavior and decision making \citep{CaseyEtAl2008}. Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) is a prominent complement to the GSM that explains behavior with two underlying neurophysiological systems: the behavioral inhibition and approach systems (BIS/BAS; \cite{carver1994behavioral,gray1970psychophysiological}). The BIS is described as a mechanism for controlling behavior leading to punishment or loss of reward through risk assessment, elevated attentional orientation, and caution in ongoing decision making processes. In contrast, the BAS responds to rewarding stimuli and opportunities to avoid or stop punishment. The BAS is described as energizing behavior directed at acquiring rewards or corrective actions for eliminating punishment. Reinforcement learning systems in the brain have been shown to mature early in adolescence, augmenting the ability to self-correct and learn from example \citep{somerville2010time}. However, this occurs at the expense of elevated sensitivity to the emotional impact of perceived rewards or punishments. This trade-off is especially significant as the inhibitory control cognitive system does not mature until well into early adulthood \citep{somerville2010developmental}. The dual-edged benefit of elevated reinforcement learning skills consequently comes with increased difficulty for inhibiting reflexive responses to punishment or reward, and arguably lowering the threshold for sensation seeking that may result in antisocial decision making \citep{LunaWright2016}. 

\paragraph{Altered Social Attitudes \& Decision Making} Taken together, the GSM and RST make useful predictions for the emergence of youth antisocial behavior. The models help us arrive at the interpretation that increased social strain through adversity and victimization can be expected to lead to elevated BAS to avoid punishment and actively work to correct perceived sources of threat, inequity, or unfairness. The BAS response to chronic strain is hypothesized to be greater in adolescents, and thus more easily inspire direct action to address the sources of strain by approaching conflict head-on through violence or by side-stepping civic rules and expectations to achieve goals -- such as elevated financial or social status. While this model may explain singular  ``heat-of-the-moment," or reflexive, acts of social deviance, there remain missing elements if we are to project the GSM + RST into a cognitive neuroscience schema that accounts for decision making as a sequence of events leading from perception, reward prediction error, belief updating, planning, and action \citep{cosmides1997dissecting,cosmides2000socialreason,van2010interpersonal}. As commonly defined, delinquency is the decision to behave in contradiction with conventional social values and does not occur as a reflexive decision made in the spur of the moment because of an overactive BAS. For example, high school students that believe, ``School is a waste of time!" will decide to skip school and do what they believe is a better use of their time. This point is illustrated by significant individual differences in antisocial behavior \citep{mazerolle1998gender}. Not all adolescents with elevated reward sensitivity and exposure to strain will commit antisocial acts. Indeed, the majority of delinquent youth are males with peer relations including other males that have similar attitudes regarding normative social values and civic responsibility \citep{mears1998explaining}. Thus, the decision to engage in deviant social behavior must, in most cases, be preceded by altered social values and moral judgements \citep{stams2006moral}. In other words, the cognitive substrate of acceptable social behavior must be internalized, whether fully fleshed out or vaguely conceptualized, prior to the formation of an intention leading to social deviance \citep{pogarsky2018offender}. In line with this hypothesis, social attitudes have indeed been reliable predictors of antisocial behavior in youth \citep{tarry2007attitudes}. Answers to questions such as ``I think guns are cool and make you feel powerful and strong," or ``I do not think that society will give me what I deserve," may provide a distinction between delinquent and non-delinquent youth that are both at risk due to strain and over-active BAS. This conceptual model is especially useful because it explicitly formulates social deviance as an outcome of a decision making process embedded in a cognitive system that integrates social, affective, and perceptual information to update normative social beliefs about the world and what constitutes socially acceptable behavior.

\paragraph{From Social Strain, to Altered Norms, to Deviance} In summary, the age-crime curve may best be understood as a macro indicator of social, neurocognitive, and developmental phenomena that interact to predict violence at the individual level. The GSM and RST together provide a logical pairing to explain how social strain may interact with developmental cognitive-behavioral processes to compound risk for adverse outcomes. However, a key missing link for explaining deviant social decision making is the role of the formation of antisocial attitudes in the context of social strain and adolescent cognitive development. In this work, we track the trajectory of risk factors in the context of adolescent cognitive development to test the relationship between GSM and RST. We then test an extension of the GSM by including altered social norms as a precursor to deviance. Models were assessed with data acquired from $141$ youth participating in the longitudinal Adolescent Development Study \citep{Fishbein2016}. The DUSI-R risk assessment battery was used to track the contribution of BIS/BAS to deviant peer relations and school problems in adolescence \citep{tarter1994reliability}. BIS/BAS scales were included as covariates of risk status at each wave of the study and expected to contribute to risk trajectories estimated with latent growth curve modeling. Baseline and rate of change in risk estimated across the first three waves were tested as predictors of violence experience measured in the final wave of the study. Initial risk status at the start of the study and subsequent rate of risk accrual were expected to result in more prominent experiences of violence when adolescents approached adulthood. An extension of the GSM that includes the role of social attitudes as a precursor to delinquency was evaluated by exploring paths from social strain that lead to deviant social values and subsequent bullying and fighting behavior. First, latent factor estimates of social safety and well-being, family and social support, violence experience, and social norms and attitudes towards violence were used to obtain cumulative metrics of social strains and attitudes. Structural equation modeling was implemented to test the causal effect of social safety and well-being on interpersonal relationships and the consequences on violence experience and social deviance. Community adversity revealed by depressed social safety and well-being was hypothesized to elevate composite strain through a deleterious effect on interpersonal relationships and an enhanced risk for experiences of violence. Prominent experiences of violence were expected to act together with social adversity to promote social deviance and delinquent attitudes.  Higher levels of anger and a lack of faith in positive future life outcomes were anticipated to also contribute to the formation of antisocial attitudes. Altered social norms in favor of  delinquency were hypothesized to be reliable indicators of fighting and bullying behavior. We also expected to find a positive effect of strain on drug use - which may serve to strengthen perceptions of social exclusion, due to the legal and cultural taboo surrounding recreational drug use. Our results demonstrate that youth at-risk for future violent outcomes can be identified early in development, and provides justification for research into preventive practices that focus on providing social support or interventions targeted to address conflict in interpersonal relations to prevent the formation of social values relating to delinquency and violence. Furthermore, we find support for a cognitive neuroscience approach in which attitudes toward acceptable social behavior may be used to potentially distinguish youth at risk for future, intentional, repeat offending from transient, impulsive, acts of delinquency.

\subsection*{Study Design} 
Volunteers were recruited from the D.C., Maryland and Virginia communities to participate in the Adolescent Development Study (ADS), a prospective longitudinal study of neurodevelopmental factors underlying early substance use initiation, escalation and the consequences of use on brain development \citep{Fishbein2016}. Youth were enrolled in 2011 and, as of March 2020, have completed up to four waves of data collection separated by approximately 18-20 months between visits. Eligibility at wave 1 included the following criteria: 1) ages 11-13 years old, 2) right-handedness, 3) no history of neuropsychiatric disorders or recent head injuries, 4) no self-reported use of drugs or alcohol and 5) no direct Asian descent. Six participants were excluded at baseline visit due to: substance use at baseline (N = $2$), autism diagnosis (N = $1$), and high scores on ambidexterity measured with the Edinburgh Handedness Test (N = $3$) \citep{veale2014edinburgh}. Sociodemographic interviews with both the parent and youth, self-reported youth drug use, and estimates of future violence proneness measured with the revised Drug Use Survey Inventory (DUSI-R) \citep{tarter1994reliability} were collected in the first three waves. The distribution of sex and race remained approximately constant throughout the study ($\pm0.5\%$) despite attrition. Participants were recontacted at wave four (average age $18.80\pm0.65$ years) and completed an interview surveying experiences of violence in adulthood along with concurrent measures of mediating factors such as: civic attitudes, family climate, peer relations, neighborhood health, victimization, and perpetration of violence. The additional surveys were selected for high validity from The Center for Disease Control’s Violence Prevention Compendium to capture quantitative indicators of experiences of violence in adulthood along with relevant environmental and social factors \citep{dahlberg2005measuring}. Participants were compensated \$$60$ for completion of an in-person visit or online survey plus travel reimbursement. All youth and caregivers gave their informed assent and consent prior to data collection and study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board.
% interview methods
\subsection*{Interview \& Assessments}
Eligible volunteers completed a series of questionnaires and interviews regarding economic status, lifestyle, peer relations, social attitudes, neighborhood dynamics and family life. Parents and/or primary guardians accompanied minors for their visit and were interviewed privately in separate rooms to encourage faithful self-reporting. Guardian and/or parents accompanying minors completed a questionnaire regarding racial identity, economic status, education and information regarding the difficulty of acquiring basic needs such as food, healthcare and housing. Socioeconomic Status (SES) was calculated from these responses by z-scoring family household income, averaging cumulative parent/guardian years of education, converting the average to a z-score, and lastly averaging the income and education z-scores for the final SES measure. Height and weight was measured to estimate normalized body mass index (BMI). The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (IQ) was administered to derive standardized scores of verbal intelligence and performance on riddles and raven’s matrices \citep{kaufman2004kaufman}. The Behavioral Inhibition (BIS), Approach Scale (BAS) was collected to measure appetitive and avoidance components of personality:  funseeking (BAS-FS), independent drive (BAS-D) and reward responsivity (BAS-RR) \citep{carver1994behavioral}.
% risk methods
\paragraph{Adolescent Violence Risk} 
Risk for future adverse outcomes (i.e., substance abuse, mood disorders, delinquent behavior) and future violence proneness was measured with the revised Drug Use Survey Inventory (DUSI-R) in adolescents from waves one through three  \citep*{tarter1994reliability}. The DUSI-R is composed of $159$ binary (``yes",``no") items grouped into $10$ sub-scales: substance abuse, behavioral problems, psychiatric disturbances, medical problems, family dysfunction, work problems, school maladjustment, social skills deficiency, peer relationship problems, and maladaptive leisure and recreation activities. The DUSI-R Violence Proneness (DUSI-VP) scale was calculated using items selected from the school ($7$ items) and peer relations ($6$ items) problems sub-scales to estimate the risk of experiencing violence, as a victim or perpetrator, in adulthood \citep*{kirisci2009violence}. The DUSI-VP is composed of items selected for predictive ability of future life adversity such as: substance abuse, injuries caused by fighting, car accidents experienced under the influence, risky sexual behavior, and delinquency.
% VExp methods
\paragraph{Experiences of Violence in Adulthood} The prominence of violence in the lives of wave four participants was assessed with composite measures of violence experience including: general perceptions, direct observations, victimization, and perpetration of violent acts at home, at school or in the community within the last $12$ months (Table 14). Violence perpetration was assessed for both acts of self-defense and proactive thrill-seeking or retribution. Coded responses (``Never" = $0$, ``Once" = $1$, ``Sometimes ($3$-$5$ times)" = $2$ and ``Often ($5+$ times)" = $3$) were summed and divided by the total number of items in each of the four sub-scales: perception of violence ($5$ items), observation of violence ($5$ items), violence victimization ($5$ items) and perpetration of violence ($6$ items). The observation, perception and victimization sub-scales also distinguish between generic and civil authority-related experiences of violence. 
% social well being methods
\paragraph{Social Safety \& Well-Being}
Measures of neighborhood disorganization, the prevalence of crime, availability of community resources, and cohesion between community members were utilized to estimate a social safety \& well-being latent factor (SSWB) with confirmatory factor analysis. The neighborhood was defined as one city block measured from the home address. The Neighborhood Resources instrument is composed of $20$ binary true/false statements used to calculate an average measure of Neighborhood Resources (NBR-R), normalized to a value between $0$ and $1$ \citep{tolan2001chicago}. The NBR-R score indicates availability of grocery stores and public services such as libraries, community centers, playgrounds and religious services. The Neighborhood Cohesion (NBR-C) scale contained seven polarized statements (Disagree, No Opinion, Agree; coded $-1$, $0$, and $1$) used to measure the sense of neighborhood belonging and the extent of shared values with other neighbors. The NBR-C was scored by averaging responses to produce a final score between $-1$ and $1$ \citep{perkins1990participation}. The Neighborhood Problems and Fear of Crime instrument contained $26$ items measuring Neighborhood Disorganization (NBR-D; $16$ items), Fear of Crime (NBR-FC; $4$ items) and Coping with Crime (NBR-CC; $6$ items). The NBR-D items contained ranked choice items (``Not a problem",``Somewhat of a problem", ``A big problem;" coded $0$, $1$ and $2$) indicating the degree of perceived problems in the neighborhood such as vandalism, racial tension, prostitution and public illegal drug use. The NBR-FC and NBR-CC sub-scales both contained binary True/False responses inquiring about the overall proliferation of neighborhood crime and actions taken to avoid, or cope with, neighborhood criminal activity. 
% family methods
\paragraph{Family Climate \& Social Support}
Overall family climate and social support was approximated using four instruments: Family Relationship Characteristics, Reactivity in Family Communication, Family Conflict, and the Vaux Social Support scale. The Family Relationship Characteristics survey contains $37$ true/false statements on family environment categorized into six sub-scales: cohesion (Fam-Co), beliefs about family (Fam-Bf), deviant beliefs (Fam-Bd) and structure (Fam-St) \citep{tolan1997assessment}. The Reactivity in Family Communication and The Family Conflict and Hostility instruments were used to assess family climate on a graded scale (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Almost always; coded as 0-4) to generate the Family Reactivity (Fam-Rx) and Family Conflict measures (Fam-Cf) \citep{thornberry2003gangs,henry2004study}. The Vaux Social Support instrument was collected to gauge extra-familial social health and support status \citep{vaux1988social}. The Social Support scale (SS) was derived from nine questions assessing the availability of emotional, practical and life support from friends, teachers, and caretakers. Question responses were coded as $0$, $1$, or $2$ (``Not at all", ``some", ``a lot"). All described measures were scored by summing across coded responses and dividing by the total number of questions to generate a normalized score between $0$ and $1$ for each sub-scale.
% social attitude methods
\paragraph{Social Attitudes}
Social attitudes were assessed with several instruments capturing normative beliefs regarding gangs, guns, violence, delinquency, prospects of future social mobility, and cooperative behavior. The Attitudes Towards Guns and Violence instrument was used to measure aggressive response to shame (AGV-S), violence-inspired excitement (AGV-E), comfort with aggression (AGV-A), and use of violence for power and safety (AGV-P) collected over $23$ survey items. Each measure was scored by averaging across responses from the set of polar choices ($-1$, $0$, and $1$; ``Disagree", ``Not sure", ``Agree") corresponding to that sub-scale \citep{shapiro1997development}. The Attitudes Towards Gangs survey is composed of nine True/False statements on perspectives towards gangs \citep{nadel1996cycle}. Responses (``Not true for me", ``True for me") were coded as binary ($0$/$1$) and averaged across items to generate a normalized score of Positive Attitudes towards Gangs (AG). The Attitudes toward Delinquency Instrument consists of $22$ items, each regarding the social acceptability of either a) personal or b) observed peer acts of delinquency. Ranked choice responses (``Not wrong", ``A little wrong", ``Wrong", ``Very wrong") were numerically coded ($0$-$3$) then averaged to produce the Aversion to Delinquency (ADQ) measure. The Peer Deviancy (PDV) scale is a graded measure of how many social relations can be qualified as risky \citep{project2004multisite} obtained by averaging $10$ ranked scale items (``None of them", ``Very few of them", ``Some of them", ``Most of them", ``All of them") coded on an ascending numerical scale from $0-5$. Civic responsibility and awareness was approximated with a modified Social Responsibility (SR) instrument \citep{nedwek1998social}. The original ranked polar responses (``Strongly agree", ``Agree", ``Disagree", ``Strongly disagree") were simplified for this study (``Agree", ``No opinion", ``Disagree") to avoid ambiguity with overlapping scales and maximize distinction between pro- and anti-social perspectives. The Hopelessness instrument was used to measure despair in regards to future prospects of social mobility using $16$ questions with binary responses regarding hopelessness and pessimistic sentiments of future life outcomes \citep{kazdin1983hopelessness}. The scale was scored by averaging across items to generate the Hopelessness measure (H). The Modified Aggression Scale was used to survey caring, cooperative, aggressive and bullying behavior using $22$ items grouped into four sub-scales: Fighting (MAg-F), Bullying (MAg-B), and Anger (MAg-A). Respondents completed questions regarding the frequency of scenarios related to fighting, anger and cooperative behavior by choosing between five ranked options indicating: ``No opportunity", ``Never", ``1 or 2 times", ``3 or 4 times", ``5 or more times" \citep{bosworth1995teen}. Each scale was scored and normalized by summing across coded responses and dividing by the total number of items within that scale. 

% statistical analysis methods
\subsection*{Statistical Analysis}
Data were converted from double-entered paper records, and Qualtrics survey exports into a coded tab separated value spreadsheet then consolidated into a single long-format data frame containing an observation for each participant at each wave using R (Orange Blossom; version 1.2.5033 \cite{R}). Descriptive statistics and assessments of multivariate normality were performed with the Arsenal (3.5.0), MVN (5.8) and DescTools (0.99.36) R packages \citep{MVN,DescTools}. All variables were screened for normally distributed residuals at each wave prior to including them in any models. Robust non-parametric estimators were used for model fitting and statistical testing in the case of non-Gaussian distributed variables and/or residuals. The DUSI-LIE scale was used to identify and exclude participants with inconsistent, incomplete, or spurious survey responses \citep{dalla2003effects}. Sessions with LIE scale greater than six were excluded from analysis. A total of thirty observations ($18$, $7$ and $5$ participants at waves one, two and three) were excluded due to high and/or missing LIE scale data. Regularized regression was implemented with R package glmnet (4.0-2) using leave-one-out cross-validation for estimation of model hyperparameters and performed only on participants with complete datasets at each wave \citep{friedman2009glmnet, FriedmanHastieTibshirani2010}. Features with non-normally distributed residuals across observations were omitted; the remaining indicators variables were centered and scaled to generate a within-measure z-score across observations prior to fitting regularized linear models. The lavaan R package was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), growth curve model fitting, structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation path analysis \citep{Lavaan}. Maximum likelihood estimation with full information maximum likelihood (FIML) implemented in the lavaan package was used to adjust parameter estimates for missing data \citep{cham2017full}. Latent factors were standardized for reporting purposes. The fit of models specified with the lavaan package was assessed in a step-wise fashion, such that the minimum number of freely-covarying parameter pairs were selected \citep{schreiber2006reporting}. Bivariate parameter correlations were sorted by modification indices (threshold $>5$) and model fit reassessed after the top pair was selected for free parameter estimation. Modification indices provide an indication of strong collinearity between pairs of variables used to estimate factor loadings. By allowing free-estimation of collinear parameter pairs, we control for partial correlations between variables, and ensure that each parameter in the model provides a unique account of the total variance observed when assessing the fit of the defined structural relationship (local independence principal; \cite{sobel1997measurement}). This way, we only choose highly collinear parameters for partial correlation in order to minimize the degrees of freedom absorbed during model specification. Goodness of fit of estimated latent factor models and their structural relations was assessed using the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) \citep{KennyEtAl2015,HuTzeBentler1999, wu2009evaluating}. Structural Equation Path models were visualized with the semPlot R package (1.1.2).

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Adolescent Risk for Violent Outcomes} The DUSI-R Violence Proneness Scale (DUSI-VP) of risk for future violent outcomes in adulthood was driven by school problems and risky peer relations escalating throughout adolescent development. DUSI-VP increased linearly from ages 11-18 years ($r=0.29$,  $p<0.001$) and was lower for higher SES families ($r=-0.17$, $p<0.001$); suggesting social advantage may provide a protective effect against violence risk in adolescence. Youth at elevated risk were significantly more likely to report drug use in adolescence, measured at waves two and three ($\chi^2 = 32.073$, $p<0.001$). DUSI-VP did not significantly covary by race, sex, BMI or IQ. Greater scores on the Drive sub-scale of the BIS-BAS instrument were correlated with higher DUSI-VP scores ($r=0.17$, $p=0.015$), suggesting that violence risk may be related to tenacious reward pursuit. A trending, but weak, bivariate correlation with violence proneness was observed for the fun-seeking sub-scale of the BIS-BAS ($r=0.11$, $p=0.10$). No significant bivariate correlations with DUSI-VP were observed for the reward responsivity or inhibitory sub-scales of the BIS-BAS. Regularized regression was used to confirm the contribution of each DUSI absolute problem density sub-scale to the DUSI-VP measure. Multivariate analysis of normality identified non-normally distributed residuals for the Work (Skew $\mu_3=2.44$; Kurtosis $\mu_4=6.79$) and Substance Abuse DUSI sub-scales (Skew $\mu_3=4.32$; Kurtosis $\mu_4=20.94$), marking them for exclusion from analysis. A regularized regression model with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO; $\alpha=1.0$) was trained using wave one DUSI-R APD sub-scales to predict DUSI-VP at waves two ($R^2=0.80$) and three ($R^2=0.76$) with high fidelity. The top explanatory variables for DUSI-VP were revealed as school ($\beta=0.92$) and peer relations ($\beta=0.33$) problems. Of the remaining sub-scales, future DUSI-VP was just weakly explained by the Health problems sub-scale ($\beta=0.024$). School problems were reported at higher levels with age ($r=0.21$, $p<0.001$), lower socioeconomic status ($r=-0.24$; $p<0.001$) and lower BMI ($r=-0.16$, $p=0.012$). Peer relations problems increased with age ($r=0.22$, $p<0.001$) and exhibited a weak trending relationship with BAS-FS ($r=0.13$, $p=0.066$). Risk for future health problems exhibited weak but significant relationships with age ($r=0.12$; $p=0.048$), SES ($r=-0.17$; $p=0.019$), BAS-D ($r=0.17$, $p=0.017$), and BIS ($r=0.13$, $p=0.026$).

\vspace{20pt}
\subsection*{Experience of Violence in Emerging Adulthood} The perception, observation, victimization and perpetration sub-scales of the Violence Experience Survey (Table 14) were used as indicator variables to derive a latent factor estimate of cumulative violence experience (VExp) at wave four. The estimated latent factor model returned a significant fit of the covariance structure compared to a null model with $0$ factor loadings between residual covariances (Table \ref{tab:3}; $CFI = 0.99$, $TLI = 0.95$; $RMSEA = 0.028$, $p = 0.40$). Modification indices revealed an enhanced fit when allowing the perception and observation measures to freely covary in the model covariance structure, signifying collinearity between perceptive notions and direct observation of violence. In other words, greater observation of violence at home, at school, or in the community was correlated with an elevated perceptive sensitivity to environmental violence. The fitted model demonstrated victimization and perpetration were unique, yet correlated, contributors to the overall experience of violence. DUSI-VP was an accurate predictor of actual self-report of VExp assayed at wave four. Females reported greater levels of VExp compared to males. No significant relationship was found between VExp and SES, BMI, wave four drug use, BIS/BAS sub-scales or composite IQ (Table \ref{tab:4}).  
%
\subsection*{Growth Curve Model of Violence Risk} The rate of change of adolescent risk for future violent outcomes proved to be a reliable predictor of actual violence experience reported at adulthood. Latent growth curve analysis returned a significant fit of the covariance structure compared to a null model with 0 factor loadings between sampled predictors at each time point, residual covariances, and the latent slope and intercept factors (Figure \ref{fig:1}; $CFI = 0.96$, $TLI = 0.92$, $RMSEA = 0.07$; $p = 0.32$). The fitted model demonstrated an average increase of $17.8\%$ in violence risk over time when accounting for BIS/BAS sub-scale scores at each time point, the effect of sex and SES on latent slope and intercept estimates, and prediction of final outcomes of experiences with violence at wave four (Tables \ref{tab:1}, \ref{tab:2}). Mean baseline risk did not significantly differ from $0$, although significant variation in intercept was observed across participants ($Z=4.573$, $p<0.001$). Regression of SES on intercept and slope showed a significant effect on baseline risk and change in risk over time. Socially advantaged youth started at lower pre-adolescent risk, but experienced a greater rate of risk accumulation as they approached adulthood. However, SES did not covary with violence measured at wave four. Adolescent drug use reported at waves two and three accounted for approximately $40\%$ of the increase in the rate of violence risk over time. No significant effect of sex on latent slope or intercept was detected. The final outcome of experiences with violence in adulthood did not significantly depend on baseline risk but was rather strongly effected by the rate of increase in risk with age. 
\subsection*{Family Dynamics and Social Support} Composite family dynamics and extra-familial social support was an important determinant of self-reported experiences of violence by participants at wave four. Family cohesion, positive and deviant family beliefs, family structure, reactivity in family communication, conflict between family members, and presence of extra-familial social support were modeled with CFA to generate a latent factor estimate of Family Dynamics and Social Support (FDSS). The latent factor model was optimized with free estimates of the covariance between social support and family reactivity, positive and deviant family beliefs, positive beliefs and cohesion, and lastly between family structure and reactivity (Table \ref{tab:5}). The estimated structural model was significant compared to a null model with $0$ factor loadings between the remaining residual covariances ($CFI=0.99$, $TLI=0.98$; $RMSEA=0.042$, $p=0.55$). Greater FDSS was characterized by elevated family cohesion, positive beliefs about family dynamics, the presence of social support from friends and adults, and lower levels of family conflict, disorganization, and reactivity. Family cohesion and positive beliefs about family were strongly correlated and provided similar indications of overall positive family dynamics. Deviant social attitudes were inversely correlated with positive beliefs about family  - suggesting that a healthy family dynamic is important for cultivating pro-social attitudes in children. Greater reactivity in family interactions and communication also resulted in elevated self-report of family conflict, which in-turn was correlated to higher levels of extra-familial social support. This result suggests young people are likely to obtain guidance and support outside of an adverse family climate. Stronger FDSS at wave four was predicted by lower adolescent risk for violent outcomes in adulthood, lower levels of self-reported drug use in adulthood, and found to be significantly greater in males compared to females  (Table \ref{tab:6}).  Elevated mean BAS-RR during adolescence was predictive of lower FDSS levels measured in adulthood. SES exhibited a trending predictive relationship with family dynamics and social support at wave four ($Z=-1.75$, $p=0.079$). No significant relationship was found between composite IQ, BMI, BIS, BAS-D, or BAS-FS with FDSS. Lower FDSS was found to be a strong predictor of violence outcomes as approximated by VExp, suggesting depressed social support, whether in the form of direct family relations or from outside influences, predicts elevated risk and greater self-report of violence experience in adulthood.

\subsection*{Social Safety and Well-Being} Neighborhood adversity and stressful life events predicted elevated violence experience. Measures of neighborhood cohesion (NBR-C), resources (NBR-R), disorganization (NBR-D), stressful life events (SLE), fear of crime (NBR-FC), and coping with community crime (NBR-CC) were used as indicators of a Social Safety and Well-Being (SSWB) latent variable estimated with CFA. The best fit latent factor model included free estimation of the covariance between NBR-D and NBR-FC, and NBR-CC and NBR-FC. The fitted structural relations were significant compared to a null model with $0$ factor loadings between the remaining residual covariances (Table \ref{tab:7}; $CFI=0.98$, $TLI=0.92$; $RMSEA=0.071$, $p=0.26$). SSWB was characterized by greater community cohesion, lower levels of community disorganization and strife, lower reporting of stressful events, and less fearful perceptions of crime in the neighborhood. Greater disorganization and community problems such as public drug use, prostitution, homelessness and vandalism was correlated with elevated fear of crime. Elevated fear of crime resulted in modification of daily activities to cope with perceived threats of crime in the community. Females reported significantly lower SSWB compared to males, suggesting female respondents were more likely to report threats of crime and community problems. Depressed SSWB was correlated with greater levels of drug and alcohol use, suggesting that elevated environmental stress promotes drug use. Lower average BMI during adolescence was found to result in a lower level of SSWB in adulthood. SSWB was not predicted by socioeconomic status, composite IQ, or BIS/BAS sub-scales. A lower SSWB score predicted significantly elevated VExp, indicating that self-reported environmental stress, proliferation of crime, and neighborhood problems are concurrent with more profound experiences of violence (Table \ref{tab:8}).

\subsection*{Social Norms and Deviancy} The sub-scales of the Attitudes towards Guns and Violence (AGV-S/E/A/P), Peer Deviancy (PDV), Aversion to Delinquency (ADQ), Attitudes toward Gangs (AG), and Social Responsibility (SR) were used as indicator variables to estimate the Social Norms and Attitudes towards Violence (SNAV) latent factor (Table \ref{tab:9}; $CFI=0.924$, $TLI=0.848$; $RMSEA=0.80$, $p=0.074$). Modification indices revealed collinearity in a subset of the indicators, which was accounted for in the model fit by partial correlation between PDV and AG, ADQ and PDV, AGV-A and ADQ, AGV-P and ADQ, AGV-P and SR, and lastly AGV-E and PDV. The fitted covariance structure revealed higher reporting of peer deviancy was related to positive perceptions of gang membership, acceptance of delinquent behavior, and greater excitement regarding gun ownership and use; suggesting that deviant peer relations may normalize the acceptability of delinquent attitudes and behavior. Greater comfort with aggression and beliefs that gun proliferation promotes social safety was indicative of negative attitudes towards delinquent behavior, suggesting that support for the use and ownership of guns is related with strong self-identification with pro-social normative behavior. This finding was corroborated with elevated social responsibility and civic duty as predictive of the belief that gun proliferation promotes social safety. Greater SNAV was predicted by a higher DUSI-VP score in adolescence, more prominent experiences of violence, and significantly greater drug use in adulthood (Table \ref{tab:10}). Males reported significantly greater SNAV compared to females, in line with population sex-differences of delinquency rates. Lower average BIS in adolescence was predictive of elevated SNAV in adulthood, suggesting adolescent behavioral disinhibition may be a marker of anti-social disposition. No significant relationship was found between SES, Composite IQ, or the BAS sub-scales and SNAV.
%The experience of violence in adulthood was strongly driven by depressed social safety and well-being acting through the fragmentation of social support to enhance vulnerability. 
\subsection*{Cascading Social-Strains Effect Social Deviance}
The cumulative effect of social-strain from community adversity, dysfunctional inter-personal relationships, and elevated experiences with violence resulted in modified attitudes toward civil social-norms and delinquency. Structural equation modeling was implemented to test two complementary paths leading to altered normative social values (Table \ref{tab:11}). First, social well-being was expected to protect against cumulative violence experience through beneficial effect of a healthy community on positive family climate, and flourishing interpersonal relationships. Second, the acceptability of social deviance and delinquency was expected to be driven by environmental social stressors mediated by violence experience. The fitted structural models showed a significant total effect through both paths from social strain leading to pro-delinquent attitudes (Table \ref{tab:12}; $CFI=1.00$,$TLI=1.071$; $RMSEA<0.001$, $p=0.878$, total model path fit $Z=-5.105$, $p<0.001$). The first path from external factors of social strain (SSWB), through family and social relationships (FDSS), and leading to experiences of violence revealed a significant total mediation of SSWB inhibiting VExp both directly and through support of the protective effect of FDSS (total mediation effect $Z=-4.96$, $p<0.001$). Violence experience was elevated with greater environmental social-strain and fragmented social support; factors that served to enhance vulnerability for confrontation with violence at home, at school, or in the community. The second path from environmental social-strain to social deviance, through violence experience, revealed a significant total mediation effect  ($Z=-4.6$, $p<0.001$) showing SSWB had direct ($Z=-3.96$, $p<0.001$) and, indirect effects on SNAV, mediated by VExp ($Z=-1.82$, $p=0.069$). Civic awareness and responsibility was shown to be less relevant in the absence of social well-being; while experiences of, and coping with, violence become a more prominent feature of daily life. Social deviance toward delinquent behavior was indicative of higher reports of bullying  and physical acts of violence (Table \ref{tab:13}). Hopelessness for attainment of future life goals was a significant predictor of SNAV, supporting that goal-blockage may motivate deviance. No relationship was found between anger (MAg-A) and SNAV. The two path analyses, together, from social adversity, through fragmentation of interpersonal relationships, and consequent experiences of violence, were found to chart significant paths leading to social deviance. No significant direct or indirect relation was found between FDSS and SNAV, indicating the relation between environmental strain and social deviance cannot be ameliorated through only improved interpersonal relationships. Direct intervention by dampening environmental strains, in addition to providing social support, are suggested to have the strongest inhibitory effect on deviance to delinquent social attitudes. 

\section*{Discussion} 
The transitional period between adolescence and emerging adulthood is a risk traversal process with ample chance of experiences leading to violence, social exclusion, and altered normative social values preceding deviance along the lifespan trajectory. The General Strain Model (GSM) and Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) together have been fielded to explain the etiological underpinnings of elevated social deviance and delinquency during emerging adulthood. RST draws from cognitive neuroscience models of adolescent neurobehavioral development to call attention to the relevance of developmental disparities in the reinforcement learning system for understanding social deviance in adolescents compared to adults. The GSM builds on RST through a framework in which elevated social strain in the form of depleted community resources and health, social exclusion, and experiences with violence interact with an overactive Behavioral Approach System (BAS) and underdeveloped Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) to facilitate sidestepping social expectations, punishment avoidance, and the pursuit of corrective action -- sometimes through direct conflict. However, not all youth experiencing elevated strain and developmental BIS/BAS imbalances will embrace social deviance and engage in delinquent behavior. This is evidenced by the gender differences in delinquency \citep{mazerolle1998gender}, the dissociation between delinquency and SES holding strain constant \citep{wright1999reconsidering}, and the controversy of IQ as a predictor of delinquency \citep{menard1984structuralist} amongst other non-conclusive relationships \citep{felson2015group}. As defined in the surveyed literature, the GSM + RST does not provide a complete framework for cognitive neuroscientists pursuing a mechanistic model of antisocial behavior from perception to action.

\paragraph{Altered Social Norms Facilitate Violence Perpetration}
The decision to engage in deviant social acts, such as delinquency or generic acts of violence, can be argued as preceded by the consolidation of moral beliefs that provide a scaffold for acting on impulsive desires to achieve desired goals; such as elevated social or financial status. In accordance with this hypothesis, developmental studies of youth violence have reported significant developmental gender differences in moral judgements. Younger male delinquents score lower on instruments of moral cognition \citep{tarry2007attitudes}, underscoring civic attitudes as an important piece in any model of adolescent social deviance and delinquency \citep{stams2006moral}. In this work, we expanded GSM + RST to account for individual differences by including altered normative social values as a precursor to bullying and fighting behavior. Our results illustrated social strain cascades from community adversity to fragmentation of interpersonal relationships; lowering the threshold for experiences of violence and driving the formation of antisocial attitudes overwhelmingly in adult males exhibiting significantly depressed BIS during adolescence. Supporting this hypothesis, elevated despair and loss of faith in social systems measured by the Hopelessness scale was revealed as a significant predictor of altered social norms. The GSM predicted anger would also contribute significantly, however no statistical relationship was found between social attitudes and self-reported anger in the sampled population. Altered normative social values were found to directly influence fighting and bullying behavior, suggesting that perpetration motivated by deviant moral beliefs may reinforce a cascading feedback loop starting from $1)$ strain to $2)$ violence experience, to  $3)$ altered moral judgement, before finally $3)$ becoming an intentional agent of violence. Importantly, our results show that many risk factors for future violent outcomes can be found in adolescence. Future violence prevention programs may be improved by targeting risk factors early in development prior to the formation of an antisocial disposition and mitigating the slippery slope to repeat offending.
\paragraph{Charting Developmental Risk Trajectories} The current study describes a systematic approach for measuring age-related change in violence risk during adolescence with the BIS/BAS and sociodemographic factors as covariates. Individual trajectories of violence risk from ages 11-21 were charted along with measurements of the BIS/BAS scale to assess the contribution of maturational imbalance between punishment aversion (BIS) and avoidance through reward seeking (BAS) to age-related risk accrual. The sampled population revealed an average 17.8\% increase in risk for future violence experience (DUSI-VP) at each wave. Baseline DUSI-VP was revealed to be significantly escalated for youth from financially disadvantaged and low education households and did not covary with sex. The rate of change in violence risk was found to accelerate over time with elevated drug use and found to be significantly higher for youth from financially advantaged households. This result suggests that although lower SES youth start off at elevated risk, youth from protected and privileged environments show an acceleration of risk as they approach adulthood; where drug use in adolescence significantly contributes to acceleration. Importantly, the presently described findings validate the DUSI-VP by demonstrating average DUSI-VP risk and rate in change of risk from ages 11 to 18 are accurate predictors of actual experiences in violence measured in adulthood. No effect was found between baseline risk at ages $11-14$ in wave one and actual experiences of violence in wave four, when adolescents were emerging into adulthood. This result suggests that early baseline risk may be determined by socioeconomic status but does not inform outcomes in adulthood. The DUSI-VP metric was decomposed by sub-scale and the most important contributions to adolescent vulnerability for violence experience in adulthood were revealed to be risky peer relations, school and health problems. Youth from economically disadvantaged and less educated households were more likely to report greater school and health problems, reinforcing the importance of social adversity for driving vulnerability to violence experience. The BAS-FS scale exhibited a relationship between risky peer relations and sensation seeking, supporting the predictions of RST.  
\paragraph{Limitations of the BIS/BAS} Although average group effects showed a significant linear correlation between tenacious reward pursuit (BAS-D) and DUSI-VP, latent growth curve analysis did not reveal a significant contribution of BIS/BAS to violence risk over time. In other words, although group average DUSI-VP generally increased with BAS-D on average, no evidence was found to support within-subject changes in violence risk are explained by age-related change in BIS/BAS sub-scales. All BIS/BAS scales were found to be surprisingly constant with age within-participants. Participants that score high on BAS scales at the onset of the study, between ages 11-14, were likely to score similarly at the third wave in the study between ages 16-18. Although initially surprising, this resonates with overall confusion in the literature regarding discrepant findings and poor fits of BIS/BAS with age \citep{pagliaccio2016revising}. We conclude that while the BIS/BAS instrument may provide a rough portrait of generic internalizing/externalizing behavior it is not a reliable indicator of actual developmental mechanisms underlying age-related changes in reinforcement learning and executive cognitive function. 
\paragraph{Signatures of Social Strain in Emerging Adulthood} Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to estimate different components of social strain at wave four to test predictions of the GSM. Social strain was modeled as a cumulative interaction between community health, strength of interpersonal relationships and experiences of violence. Social safety and well being was overwhelmingly depressed in females compared to males and strongly predicted both violence experience and elevated drug use in adulthood. Greater drug use may be a coping response to loss of positive reinforcement or to overwrite negative emotions stemming from social strain. Path analysis revealed healthy communities and cohesive neighborhoods exhibit a beneficial effect on interpersonal relationships both within and outside of the family. Males reported greater positive family dynamics and social support compared to females, a surprising finding given the widespread belief that females are more likely to nurture and maintain positive social relationships. Although we can not venture a satisfying explanation for this discrepancy with the fielded metrics, we do believe the significant effect of reward responsivity may provide a clue. We interpret the results as that males with elevated BAS-RR are more likely to impress and seek social affirmation, whereas females may find more difficulty in negotiating family dynamics and interpersonal problems in emerging adulthood. Higher levels of social support and healthy family dynamics were found to be a protective factor against experiences of violence and indirectly mediated an inhibition of the formation of antisocial attitudes. Greater acceptance of delinquency, lower civic responsibility and higher comfort with aggression and the use of guns was strongly driven by experiences of violence. Overall experiences of violence were summarized as perceptual acuity to violence in the neighborhood as well as both victimization and perpetration of violence, either for thrill seeking or to protect oneself or others. We decided to include both victimization and perpetration as components of violence experience \textit{a priori} because of the well-known correlation between victimization and perpetration, making it very difficult to disentangle the two. Although we would have liked to further explore distinctions between violence perpetrated in self defense, our study did not have significant power to dissociate individual differences. Nonetheless, confirmatory factor analysis corroborated the unique contribution of both violence victimization and perpetration to the overall experience of violence. Females reported significantly greater experiences of violence compared to males, an effect that was exacerbated by the direct and indirect effect of social well-being acting through fragmented interpersonal relationships on experiences of violence. Sex effects were perpetuated in the contribution of violence experience to the formation of antisocial attitudes. Although females were most likely to report greater experiences of violence, males were more likely to exhibit an antisocial disposition in response to elevated violence experience. Deviant social attitudes were predicted by greater levels of drug use in emerging adulthood and lower behavioral inhibition measured with BIS and greater average DUSI-VP in adolescence. These results illustrate the overall signature of social strain and how it contributes to the formation of antisocial attitudes. The sex effects are incredibly salient and show a cohesive sequence of events leading from neighborhood safety, to family dynamics and interpersonal relationships, to experiences of violence, and finally altered social norms. Males exposed to violence are more likely to embrace social deviance and engage in fighting or bullying behavior compared to females. This is driven by a depressed inhibition system and pre-existing risk factors that carry over from adolescence.
\paragraph{Limitations \& Conclusions} The present study describes how violence risk cascades from adolescence into adulthood through the exacerbation of pre-existing risk factors  and the propagation of social strains that may form a positive feedback loop between violence experience and delinquency. Although the RST provides a useful schema for understanding youth risk for violence, the BIS/BAS instrument is not a statistically useful metric of individual neurocognitive developmental trajectories. The present work encourages researchers to employ neuropsychological metrics in place of coarse surveys that approximate self-reported idiosyncratic differences in internalizing and externalizing behavior. Our results demonstrate the very strong sex effects in violence perpetration appears to stem from sex differences in the effect of social strain on interpersonal relationships, experiences of violence and the formation of antisocial attitudes. Furthermore, we provide empirical support that mechanistic cognitive models of delinquency are incomplete with accounting for the formation of moral beliefs that precede intentional perpetration of violence. The current study is limited in scope due to the small and geographically limited sample size. The described results suggest a strong positive-feedback cycle of social strain acting on violence experience and perpetration. However our current study only samples violence experience once in adulthood and does not control for lifelong victimization. Future longitudinal studies can validate the results described here by tracking young people that are naive to lifetime violence experience and follow the evolution of their moral maturity into adulthood as they become exposed to strain. All in all, we anticipate the results described in this paper to provide a sturdy foundation for extending cognitive neuroscience to help inform mechanistic models of youth social deviance and delinquency and to aid the development of youth violence prevention programs.

% "the nonrandomness of changes in individuals' behavior during the life cycle is reflected in the orthogenetic principle that development exists when a system changes from being organized in a very general, undifferentiated way to having differentiated parts that are organized into an integrated hierarchy (Werner 1957; Kaplan 1983) From that perspective can we not conceptualize offending as a behavior that initially is generalized and unspecific and which b ecomes more and more patterned over time?" --> social cognition development, refinement of attitudes and normative values are influenced by a priori strain - see Lober and Le Blanc

\caption{\textbf{Mediation analysis of paths to altered social norms.} Structural equation modeling was used to explore two complementary paths to altered social norms represented as elevated SNAV. Path $1$ showed a significant direct relationship from depressed social safety and well-being to elevated experiences of violence ($p<0.001$) and indirect path to VExp through fragmentation of family and social support ($p=0.038$). Path $2$ revealed elevated experiences of violence, mostly directly ($p=0.041$) and partially indirectly through depressed SSWB ($p=0.069$), caused greater acceptance of antisocial behavior. Family dynamics and social support did not exhibit a direct or indirect relationship with SNAV. Depressed SSWB was the strongest determinant of antisocial disposition ($p<0.001$). The total effect of both paths leading from SSWB through FDSS to VExp and from SSWB through VExp showed a significant total mediation ($p<0.001$).
